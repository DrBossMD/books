# Contagious
### Why things catch on
### By Jonah Berger

## 0. Introduction

There are six principles of contagiousness:
* Social currency
* Triggers
* Emotion
* Public
* Practical value
* Stories

## 1. Social currency

People share things in order to exchange a sort of social currency, they tell other's things in order to raise their status. 

If something is remarkable, they will want to share it with others because it makes them sound remarkable. 

You have to leverage game mechanics to make people go the extra mile, e.g. frequent flyer miles

It's important to make people feel like insiders. 

## 2. Triggers

People talk about things when they are triggered. E.g. people talk about Cheerios every morning because they see Cheerios every morning for breakfast. 

In order to be effective, triggers need to be appropriately frequent and they need to include context.

## 3. Emotion

There are several observations that were made as to why people shared things:
* Articles that are more interesting or more useful were share significantly more
* Articles that instilled awe were more that 30% likely of being shared

It turns out that in general, emotion boosts sharing, but not every emotion works the same. 

For example, articles instilled sadness had a negative effect on sharing, and decreased the likelihood of an article being shared by 16%

It was the realized that there are emotions that have **high arousal**

It is these emotions that ail trigger people to share, both 
* Awe, Excitement, Amusement are positive high arousal emotions
* Anger and Anxiety are negative high arousal emotions that will still increases the likelihood of something being shared. 

In order to effective, marketing should focus on facts, not feelings, especially around these high arousal emotions. 

In book **Made to Stick** the authors discuss how to use *Three Why's* to find the emotional core of an idea. When you ask this repeatedly, you will not only uncover the core of an idea, but also the emotion behind it. 

If you are using emotion to drive sharing, you need to pick ones that are high arousal and will drive people to action.

Exercise is aslo a strong stimulant that will cause people to share more, because exercise triggers arousal. 

Thus, any arousal, whether origination from physical or emotional sources, and every situational arousal, can boost transmission. 

## 4. Public

One of the key factor in driving products to catch on  is public visibility. **If something is built to show, it's built to grow**. 

Social proof causes people to imitate other people. People are like sheep, if they see or assume that others are doing something, they will imitate. 

This is even true for kidneys. A lot of people turn down kidneys because they assume that a kidney that is available must not be very good as people have previously rejected it. 

The Movember foundation was successful because they were able to make the private public. That means that they took something like caring about cancer from being personal, to something that everyone could see.  

> ”Through their actions and words participants raise awareness by prompting private and public conversations around the often ignored issue of men's health"

Most products are consumed privately, but it is crucial to make the private public. You do this by generating public signals, i.e. lyft mustache, movember mustaches, armstrong yellow bracelet. 

Hotmail instilled social proof by having every email sent include "Sent from Hotmail." They leveraged observability, and every time someone sent an email the footer would be an implicit endorsement for a new service. 

If people don't use your product all the time, you can generate social proof that sticks around using **behavioral residue**

Livestrong picked yellow bracelets because it was smart from an observability perspective. 
* Yellow is a color that people almost never see
* It's striking, and stands out against most of what people wear, so its easy to spot

The public visibility was key to the success. 

> ”The nice thing about a wristband is that it lives on. The bike ride doesn't…. The wristband lives on as a reminder every day of this sort of stuff."

**Behavioral Residue** is the physical traces or remnants that actions or behaviors leave in their wake. 

## 5. Practical Value

People like to pass along practical, useful information. News others can use. 

People share practically valuable information to help others. 

If Social Currency is about information senders and how sharing makes them look, Practical Value is mostly about the information receiver. 

People don’t evaluate things in absolute terms, they evaluate relative to a comparison standard, or reference point.

People use the price they expect to pay for something as their reference point for deal. So a grill marked down from $350 to $250 seems like a better deal than the same grill marked down from $255 to $240. Setting a higher reference point made the first deal seem better even though the price was higher overall. 

Consumers are so focused on getting a good deal that, as the barbecue grill example showed, they sometimes even end up paying more to get it. 

Using the word sale beside a price increased sales even though the price itself stayed the same. In an experiment, **some cases showed that marking items on sale could rails demand by more than 50**%. 

Diminishing sensitivity reflects the idea that the same change has a smaller impact the farther that it is from the reference point. 

Deals seem more appealing when they highlight incredible value. The more remarkable something is, the more likely it will be discussed. 

The availability of a deal will factor into into how valuable it its. Making promotions more restrictive can actually make them more effective— restricting availability through scarcity and exclusivity makes things seem more valuable.

Offers that are available for a limited time are appealing because of the restriction. Just like making the product scarce, the fact that a deal won’t be around forever makes people feel like it must be a really good one. 

Quantity limits work the same way. Even restricting who has access can make a promotional offer seem better. 

The mere fact that not everyone can get access to a promotion makes it seem more valuable. 

### The rule of 100

Researchers find that whether a discount seems larger as a money or percentage off depends on the original price. 

**If the product’s price is less than $100, the percentage discount will seem larger**. 

### Keys to why some content gets shared more

The firs is how the information is packaged. If done correctly, practically valuable information not only is useful, but demonstrates a company’s knowledge and expertise in the domain. 

The second key is audience. Content with a narrower audience may actually be more likely to be shared because it reminds people of a specific friend of family member and makes them feel compelled to pass it along. 
 
Practical value is about helping. We need to make it clear why our product or idea is so useful that people just have to spread the word. **News you can use**.

## 6. Stories

People don’t think in terms of information. They think in terms of *narratives*. But while people focus on the story itself, information comes along for the died.

Stories can act as vessels, carriers that help transmit information to others. 

The magic of stories: **Information travels under the guise of what seems like idle chatter**.

The Fooling the Pool stuns failed on many levels, one of them being that it had nothing to do with the product it was trying to promote. Even though people talked about the stuns, they didn’t talk about the casino. 

When trying to generate word of mouth, many people forget one important detail. They focus so much on getting people to talk that they ignore the part that really matters: **what people are talking about**. 

The key, then, is to not only make something viral, but also make it valuable to the sponsoring company or organization. Not just virality but **valuable virality**. 

Virality is most valuable when the brand or product is integral to the story. When it’s woven so deeply in the narrative that people can’t tell the story without mentioning it. 

In trying to craft contagious content, valuable virality is critical. That means making the idea or desired benefit a key part of the narrative. 

In an experiment that looked out how details of a stories are lost as it is shared it was found that: **Around 70% of the story details were lost in the first 5-6 transmissions**. People mentioned the critical details but left out the extraneous ones. 

## 7. Epilogue
