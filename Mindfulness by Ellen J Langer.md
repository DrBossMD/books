# Mindfulness by Ellen J Langer

# 1. Introduction

Social psychologists usually look for the ways in which behavior depends on context. When mindless, people treat information as though it were context-free— true regardless of circumstances

# 2.  When the light’s on and nobody’s home

People will comply more to requests if a response is given, whether the response is legitimates or silly. People will respond mindlessly to the familiar framework rather than mindfully attending to the content. 

Highly specific instructions (request for Ace bandage) encourage mindlessness. Once we let them in, our minds snap shut like a clam on ice and do not let in new signals. 

# 3. The Roots of Mindlessness

The way we take in information (that is, mindfully or mindlessly) determines how we will use it later. This is a kind of premature cognitive commitment. Eg.
* Subjects given info about a disease that was apparently irrelevant to them became more vulnerable to the systems
* Once they discovered that they had the disorder they performed poorly
* They performed half as well as as those comparison subjects who had assumed all along that they might have the disorder and thus had reason to reflect on how to compensate it


One of the main reasons we may become entrapped by the absolute categories we create (or are given) rather than accept the world as dynamic and continuous is because we believe that resources are limited. If there are clear and stable categories, then we can make rules by which to dole out these resources. If resources weren’t so limited, or if these limits were greatly exaggerated, the categories wouldn’t need to be so rigid. 

# 4. The Costs of Mindlessness

No specific takeaways, a lot of interesting experiments and results

# 5. The Nature of Mindfulness

Re: Kutuszov’s defeat of Napoleon in Russia, we find that Kutuzov portrayed the key qualities of a mindful state of being: 
1. creation of new categories
2. openness to new information
3. awareness of more than one perspective

A process orientation not only sharpens our judgment, it makes us feel better about ourselves. A purely outcome orientation can take the joy out of life. 

> In some Japanese firms, the thinkers and innovators are specifically encouraged to be process-oriented— the results can come later. 


# 6. Mindful Aging

When old people in a home were experimented on, the more decisions and control required of the subjects, the more likely they were to have become: 
1. less depressed
2. more independent and confident
3. more alert and differentiated in their choices

When we are young we answer questions about old age with the feeling that we never grow old. Thus we form mindsets about the relationship between debilitated performance and old age. Once we become old, those relationships become threatening and fees begin. These fears are inhibiting and likely to discourage our older sleeves from trying to extend ourselves in new ways. 

When a bunch of old people were told to think and behave like they were 20y younger,  changes of all kinds, most positive, were found. This was when they were 75, at an age where growth and development are considered arrested or in decline. 

# 7. Creative Uncertainty

When our minds are set on one thing or on one way of doing things, mindlessly determined in the past, we blot our intuition and miss much of the present world around us. If Archimedes had had his mindset only on taking a bath, he probably would not have discovered the displacement of water. By keeping free of mindsets, even for a moment, we may be open to see clearly and deeply. 

The more <<something>> appears, the more it is likely to be perceived as an unconditional fact. *After all, how can you argue with what everyone knows what to be true?*

The ability to transcend context is the essence of mindfulness and central to creativity in any field. 

# 8. Mindfulness on the Job

For employer and employee alike, mindfulness may increase flexibility, productivity, innovation, leadership ability, and satisfaction. 

When we near the end of activities that we expect to be tiring, fatigue arrives. This mental picture of the end of a task is a self imposted context and makes fatigue almost inevitable. Changing contexts before reaching this point may prevent fatigues. 

Creating new categories, exploring multiple perspectives, and focusing on process al increase the possibility that a novel approach to a problem will be discovered. A tolerance for uncertainty on the part of management is also encouraging. If a manager can risk deviation from routine ways of doing things, creative employees can thrive and contribute, and will be compelled not only make a product better and better, but also make a different, better product.

If a manager is confident but uncertain— confident that the job will get done but without being certain of exactly the best way of doing it — employees are likely to have more room to be creative, alert, and self-starting. 

> *“Mindlessness is the application of yesterday’s business solutions to today’s problems.”*

> *“Mindfulness is attainement to today’s demands to avoid tomorrow’s difficulties.”*

# 9. Decreasing Prejudice by Increasing Discrimination

Greater mindfulness generated by a handicap (or other difference) can create yet one more way in which the person differs from the majority. Greater mindfulness may lead to original perceptions that others may view as bizarre. These perceptions are often more informed.

Didn’t really understand the whole thing on deviance. 

# 10. Minding Matters: Mindfulness and Health

Contexts are learned. Thus most of what provokes emotion is learned. And these emotional contexts are learned in a single minded way. Emotions rest upon premature cognitive commitments. 

Two ways that influence health: 
* exchanging unhealthy mindsets for healthy ones
* increasing a generally mindful state

# 11. Beyond Mindfulness

The most important function task for any CEO, and for the rest of us, is choosing what to be mindful about.
