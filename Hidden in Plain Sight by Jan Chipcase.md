# Hidden in Plain Sight by Jan Chipcase

# 0. Introduction

In the situations we all talk for granted, you should constantly ask yourself: “Why are they doing that? And why in that particular way?”

**Emergent behaviors** are essentially things that people have only started doing and that might, if the conditions are right, become widespread. 

When traveling, those whole allow themselves to get lost in the new environment and have fewer guarantees and a greater risk of disappointment (and mugging), but there there is also an infinitely greater chance of new and unique experiences that will prompt new ideas and points of views. 

If you’re looking to get ahead in your own field, you need to think about where you need to be situated to be able to learn the most, and ask yourself why you aren’t there already. 

# 1. Crossing State (of Mind) Lines

Military researchers have found that administering a dose of a brain hormone called orexin A allowed monkeys deprived of sleep for up to thirty-six hours to perform as well on cognitive tests as their well-rested peers. 

What sort of tools can we design in the future to help people stay within their comfort zones? What sort of tools could even expand those comfort zones? 

Every time you face a spending decision, you’re expending some amount of cognitive energy, paying what’s known in behavioral economics as a mental transaction cost. When that psychological toll surpasses the value of the purchase itself, you’ve reach the **threshold of concern**.

# 2. The Social Lives of Everyday Objects

**BOOK:** The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, Erving Goffman

Interactions can be described in terms of dramatic performances, in which every individual involved plays dual roles of performer and audience. Every performance is carried out within a setting and revolves around a scene — the situation. Any performer can attempt to define a situation, but things get awkward if there’s not a consensus. Some situations have reestablished definitions and codes of behavior, and it is assumed that everyone involved knows how to perform appropriately. 

The **Veblen Effect** suggests that consumer demand depended not only on the functional utility of goods but also on certain social factors: 
* a desire to be in style
* a desire to stand out from the herd
* a desire for “conspicuous consumption”

**BOOK:** The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen

*“In order to gain and to hold the esteem of men it is not sufficient merely to possess wealth or power. The wealth or power must be put into evidence, for esteem is awarded only evidence. And not only does the evidence of wealth serve to impress one’s importance on others and to keep their sense of his importance alive and alert, but it is of scarcely less use in building up and preserving one’s self-complacency.” —Veblen*

*“Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods or of services or human life, huns the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer’s good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities. In order to be reputable it must be wasteful. No merit would accrue from the consumption of the bare necessities of life, except by comparison with the abjectly poor who fall short even of the subsistence minimum; and no standard of expenditure could result from such a comparison, except the most prosaic and unattractive level of decency.”— Veblen*

Conspicuous designer labels could elicit significantly more job recommendations, greater amounts of money collected for charity, and higher levels of cooperation in money sharing games. 

It’s good to understand why we don’t break unwritten rules, instead of just assuming that we can’t. 

The notion of easy access creates a valid social excuse for the phone on the table, just as the notion of beauty or style creates a social excuse for expensive cloths and jewelry, and the notion of thrill -seeking creates an excuse for sports cars and wristwatches with built-in altimeters.

Traditionally, in Asian cities, home ownership rates have been low, so the notion of remodeling and home improvement is a relatively new one, albeit a blooming one: in Shanghai, the rate of home ownership went from 36% in 1997 to 82% in 2005. 

Smart merchandises find ways of generating **masstige**, prestige for the masses, by giving aspirants some facet of what they want in a way that fits within spending constraints, creating new markets by developing products that lower the barriers to entry. E.g. Ferrari keychains, startup T-shirts

A great example of **masstige** is the Apple earbuds. They cost much cheaper than an actually Apple device, but for someone who can’t afford the device, it’s a great gateway into the Apple ecosystem.

# 3. Riding the Waves of the Past, Present, and Future

For companies looking to bring new products and services into market, understanding the push and pull of adoption— where personal motivations, context and cultural norms collide— is critical to success. 

The Beal and Bohlen **diffusion process** breaks down the five stages an individual goes through on the path to adoption: 
1. **Awareness:** the individual learns that the new thing exits, but he may know know what it is or what it does. 
2. **Interest:** the individual may still not know much about the thing, but he has heard enough to get a sense that it might be useful, and is worth checking out
3. **Evaluation:** a sort of mental test run where the individual imagines the new thing in his life
4. **Trial:** an actual test run
5. **Adoption:** large scale continued user of the idea, and satisfaction with the idea. 

**PAPER:** The Google Effects on Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having Information at Our Fingertips

The presence of internet access lowered people’s ability to recall specific information from memory, but increased their ability to recall how and where to access it online. 

At a certain point, adult users began buying phones for relatives, because the cost of a new phone outweighed the inconvenience of being unable to reach those relatives. 

**BOOK:**  Ne twork Models of the diffusion of Innovations, Thomas Valente

The key factor in adoption is the number of one’s peers who adopt and innovation; when that number reaches the individual’s threshold, that individual will in turn adopt the innovation. 

Three lessons form Valente’s studies: 
1. The adoption curve timeline only tells part of the story, and people who adopt at the same time are not necessarily influences in the same way. 
2. Some people, regardless of whether they’re early adopters, in the majority, or laggards, are immediately influenced by their peers while others will monitor their peers’ behaviors for some time before making a decision.
3. People who may be considered laggards relative to the greater social system could be early adopters within their own personal networks, or vice versa, depending on how their networks are externally connected to the social system.

Porn is compelling content, in that the demand for it is sufficiently strong to drive the means to consume it. Or to put it in another way: porn has the power to drive technology adoption.

**BOOK:** What Technology Wants, Kevin Kelly

# 4. You Are What You Carry

What you carry, what you consider essential, and, more important, why you carry these things can provide considerable insight into everything from day-to-day activities to hopes, values, beliefs, fears, how people relate to the world around them, and how the world out there relates back to them.

On the most basic level, the things we carry, The things we absolutely need when we go out into the world, are the tools that help us survive.

The **range of distribution** is the distance that people are willing to let physical objects stray when they're out and about.

The high visibility and symbolic value that at one point made Apple’s white earbud headphones so popular are also significant drivers for theft.

We call these places were portable object's tend to cluster **centers of gravity**.

The idea of periodic, systematic reminders based on context and necessity is one can extend to problems and needs far beyond physical objects.

The desire to maintain preternatural awareness for the purpose of avoiding loss and theft is still strong enough to make this area right for disruption, especially as the means to track things grow even more sophisticated

There opportunities to design digital points of reflection, When the system knows what you're forgetting before you forget it.

If our goal is to lighten consumers’  loads to help them be more efficient with what they carry, we could try to either reduce the risk of losing things, reduce the cost of recovering or replacing those things, or make it easier to live without carrying these things around. One of the simplest ways to accomplish all three is to **allow people to use more while owning less**.

**BOOK:** The Mesh: Why the Future of Business is Sharing, Lisa Gansky

Losing those lifelines left us feeling naked, more exposed to dangers you would associate with the border town in time of conflict, But it also forced us to heighten awareness of where we were at every moment, where we had come from, and how to get back.

# 5. Calibrating Your Cultural Compass

Across the globe, the best time to observe a city is around the crack of dawn and the hours that follow. It's not that the afternoon or night doesn't reveal things that can be found at other times, but that the start of the day tends to be more consistent and more regimented the day’s end.

You can never understand the stresses and pains the a city’s inhabitants feel until you felt the worst of it's commute.

There is much empathic understanding to be gained from breaching, and there are many ways to test the impact of crossing line, from role-play within the team to staged situations out in the field to small impromptu interventions when you send the possibility of enlightening experience.

The urban science that can be the most revealing about current and changing societal assumptions are of the “do this” and “don’t do that” variety. 

The mere existence of a signed reveals that what ever issue it pertains to is important enough for someone, presumably an authority on the matter, to invest time and energy to discuss the possibility of a formal or informal ban with other people in the know, rommission production of the sign, and have it installed.

Some signs document the evolution of technology. The phone depicted in the “no mobile phones” site has evolved over the years from Motorola's iconic brick to Nokia’s Candybar to Apple's iPhone, with each generation in turn looking as outdated as the next, at least until the form factor settles or usage disappears.

The Zeitgeist is much bigger than contemporary trends and styles: it's a mood, an essence, a and through cultural absorption a good designer can gain an intuition about whether designs are congruent or incongruent with the zeitgeist

# 6. A Matter of Trust

When you make a decision, you're implicitly and explicitly considering things both large and small: from contextual clues like whether other customers are present and taking on the risk themselves, to a lifetime’s worth of experiences in these kinds of contexts; the value of the brand and what it stands for; to the impact if things go wrong. 

The **trust ecosystem**— the context in which we make each trust-district decision, characterized by the surrounding environment and all its players, from the local crime rate to the sights and smells at hand to the friendliness of strangers— shapes each and every interaction that takes place within it. 

**We trust those things that live up to their claims and distrust those that fall short.**

There are 6 dimensions on which we evaluate trustworthiness: 

**Authenticity:**
> When a product possesses qualities consistent with our expectations of what that product should contain, we consider authentic. Authenticity is subjective and culturally dependent.

**Fulfillment:**
> When a product does exactly what it says on the tin. We trust those things that live up to their claims and distrust those who fall short. 

**Value:**
> A level of quality commensurate with price relative to alternatives; in simpler terms, we trust things that don’t feel like a rip-off. 

**Reliability:**
> Similar to fulfillments, but it also means a product does what it’s supposed to do with consistency that we can count on it performing in those moments when we need it the most. 

**Safety:**
> We don’t trust things that we believe will cause serious physical or psychological damage to ourselves, others, or the environment. 

**Recourse:**
> A sense of assurance, either explicit or implicit, that if a product fails or breaks down, the manufacturer or retailer will deal with the problem in a timely and courteous manner. 

When a company is trusted, 51% of people are willing to believe positive information about the company after hearing it once or twice, while only 25% will believe negative information the first couple of times they hear it. But when a company is distrusted, 57% will believe negative information about the company after hearing it once or twice, and a mere 15% will believe positive information. 

As Coke’s leaders found when the misguidedly introduced New Coke, **consumers will decide what’s authentic and what’s not**. 

Next time you’re out shopping, look at 2-3 products in the same category and think about what makes you trust one more than the other.
* Is it the brand names?
* Your past experiences?
* The design of the packaging? 
* The price? 

Then think about the relative price you’re willing to pay for a trustier product? 

While you’re comparing the trustworthiness of products, think about what sniff tests they offer, if any, and what it would take to not only build in the mechanisms, but also make them worth paying attention to. 

When lacking alternatives, consumers are often willing to lower their trust thresholds. 

# 7. Finding the Essence

**If we start stripping things back to the bare essentials, we can build or rebuild our understanding of services from the ground up.**

**BOOK:** The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman

**BOOK:** The Laws of Simplicity, Maeda

**Creeping featurism** is a disease, fatal if not treated promptly, which can be cured with a heavy dose of organization, but as usual, the best approach is to practice preventive medicine. 

Lateral thinking exercises can be hugely useful in rethinking something in terms of its essence. 
* Map out all of the attributes of a panda toy, such as color, size, endangered
* Map out the attributes of commercial banking
* Brainstorm how to work in panda attributes into banking in some way

Building a process around the sort of essence-level brain storming provides structure for creative ideation, which for most people is extremely difficult unless they’re able to escape the constraints of their assumptions. It’s a process of deconstruction and reconstruction. 

American ‘pit stop’ gas stations, which have struggled in recent years—since 1991, when there were almost 200,000 gas stations in the US, more than 50,000 of them have shuttered— profits from sales of gas are hard to come by, so snacks and drinks are indispensable to keep the remaining stations afloat. 

**Alway think:**

* What if every point of sale terminal was an ATM?
* And what if every mobile phone was a point of Sale? 
* **What if every [common item] was [something valuable]?**

It’s important to think about how to make a commonplace item, like a phone, so much more than it actually is.  

There are new ventures that set out to capture the absolute purest possible essence of something, only to strip away a bit too much and miss the mark. 

[???]lout of the Tata Nano, which promised to revolutionize car ownership by developing the absolute cheapest possible car in the world. What the makes of the Tata nano failed to realize was that the essence of car ownership is not just four wheels and an engine, but also the social status conferred by being a car owner— which in the Nano’s case was the stigma of being seen as the owner of the cheapest car in the world.
