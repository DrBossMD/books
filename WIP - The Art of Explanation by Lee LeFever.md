# The Art of Explanation
### Making your ideas, produces and services easier to understand
### By Lee LeFever

## Part 1: Plan

## 1. Learning to Run

Analogy that learning to explain is like learning to run. You can get better but most people don’t realize they suck at it, and that there are ways to improve. 

## 2. What Is an Explanation? 

Miriam Webster definition of v. explain: 
> To make Known; to make plain or understandable.

Wikipedia definition of explanation: 
> An explanation is a set of statements constructed to describe a set of facts which clarifies the causes, context and consequences of those facts. 

An explanation is an *act or process* that makes something *known, plain or understandable*.

**Explanation**— An explanation describes facts in a way that makes them understandable. The intent of an explanation is to increase understanding. 

What do great explainers have in common? **Empathy.**

Great explainers have the ability to picture themselves in another person’s shoes and communicate from that perspective. 

Explanation is a powerful asset in a world of constant change; because it can lower the cost of understanding, it invites people to participate in a variety of new topics. 

Explanation is the art of not just packaging facts but presenting them in a way that answers the question *”Why?”*— as in, why does it make sense to do this? Or, why should I care? 

Explanation is not focused on facts, laws, or specifics. Explanation is the art of showing why the facts, laws and specifics make sense. By clarifying the reason that an idea makes sense, we can put the facts into perspective.

As such, **explanation is the practice of packaging facts into a form that makes them easier to understand and apply**. 

Explanations that make people care also have another benefit: **people who care about and ideas are often motivated to learn more**.

The act of explaining helps us understand anode more completely. 

## 3. Why Explanations Fail

Blank stares often arise when someone has lost confidence that they can grasp— or should even care about— the idea you are communication. 

**Curse of knowledge**: When we know a subject very well, we have a difficult time imagining what it is like not to know it. 

Our level of knowledge interferes with our ability to see the world from another person’s perspective and gauge their confidence level accurately. 

_**READ**_: [The Curse of Knowledge](http://hbr.org/2006/12/the-curse-of-knowledge/ar/1), from HBR

When you talk about an idea and you see blank stares, it could be the curse of knowledge at work. People are losing condense, and you explanation is starting to fail. 

The more we live in a culture and use it’s own language, the more the curse of knowledge grows. Certain words and phrases become so common that we start to lose touch with how they sound to people who live outside of that culture. 

**A single word can make your explanation fail because it lowers confidence. One word has the power to move someone from interest to disinterest.**

Explanation fail when we are unable to translate the language of our work to the language of a possibly uninformed audience. 

### The direct approach

When people ask questions like *”How does that work?”*, we tend to answer the question directly if we know the answer. It feels efficient. 

The problem is that this can cause the listener to lose confidence. The question wanted for an **explanation**, what they received was a **statement of fact**.

Giving direct, accurate, and factual answers may seem to solve the problem from the perspective of the answerer. But in reality, it can shut the asker down. 

**When they lose confidence, they won’t dare to ask follow up questions or probe for related ideas. Any hope of being a customer of that idea is lost**. 

## 4. Planning Your Explanations

Without a way to explain an idea effectively, we limit its ability to spread. 

### The explanation scale

This is a simple A-to-Z continuum that is a guid to planning explanations. It’s a way to think of moving your audience from one point to another. 

The goal is to move people down the scale, representing a path to understanding an idea. 

## Part 2: Package

## 5. Packaging Ideas

The solution to make ideas easier for others to understand is packaging. There are innumerable ways to package ideas, but they focus on a few elements: 

**Agreement**: builds confidence from first sentence. This is accomplished through big picture statements that most people recognize. i.e. “We can all agree that gas prices are rising.”

**Context**: moves the agreed points into a specific place. Gives audience a foundation for the explanation, tells them why it matters. * i.e. “More of your hard earned income is going to pay for transportation”

**Story**: Applies the big ideas to a narrative. Shows a person who experiences a change in perspective and the emotions that accompany that change. * i.e. “Meet Sally; she’s tired of paying so much for gas and needs alternatives. Here’s what she found:”

**Connections**: These often accompany a story and are analogies and metaphors that connect new ideas to something a person already understand. i.e. “Sally could see that taking the bus was like multitasking because she could work and commute at the same time.”

**Descriptions**: direct communications that are more focused on how versus why. i.e. “Sally found that she could save more than $20 a week by taking the bus 3x weekly”

**Conclusions**: Wraps up the packaged with a summary of what was learned, and provides a next step with focus on the audience. i.e. “The next time gas prices get you down, remember…”


## 6. Context

Context matters. Our ideas may be useful, actionable, and informative, but without context, they are limited. If they exist without a foundation or connection to other ideas, they are isolated, and that isolation limits their potential. 

The problem is we neglect to include enough context when relation ideas. Inside the juggle, everything is a tree and context isn’t needed—everyone knows the forest. But when we step out of the bubble, everything changes, and we have to focus on the forest to make our ideas understandable. 

Explanations often cover questions of both how and why. People need to see why first, but as they start understanding more, how becomes more important. 

### Context in Explanation—We Can All Agree

Using context effectively is an invitation to stay engaged, see value, and be impressed. In most cases, developing context can be a simple matter of making a few declarative statements. These can be non-controversial ideas that most people in the audience will find accurate and provable. The idea is to start an explanation by creating a sense of agreement. we want the audience to feel that they agree with the statements and are confident that the explanation is heading in a direction they can grasp. 

When presented effectively, these statements give audiences and invitation that accomplishes the following goals: 
* They create a baseline for the talk. 
* They give her presentation a sense of direction. 
* They give her audience confidence that her presentation is about something they understand or have interest in. 
* They explain the forest

### Context and Pain

A common story arc includes these basic elements: A character needs or wants something. He or she despairs without it, and must overcome a hurdle to get it. He or she is eventually successful. 

This storyline can be put in these terms: 
* Meet Bob, he has a problem and feels pain
* He discovers a solution and tries it
* Now he feels happy
* Don’t you want to feel like bob

This framework for storytelling succeeds because it plays to basic human emotions. 

This applies to explanations. For example, and explanation that builds context—not just about the world at large, but how that world impacts and causes pain for someone—can be very compelling. The context then becomes the person’s feelings, which can be very powerful. 

### On The Explanation Scale

The left side of the scale is often focused on establishing why, as in, “Why should I care?” This is certainly the case with agreement and context. At this point we’re also focused on building audience confidence and helping them feel that the explanation applies to them as being presented in a way they can grasp. 

## 7. Story

### Stories Versus Facts

Facts give stories **substance**. 
Stories give facts **meaning**. 

Substance and meaning are two of the most powerful factors in any explanation. However, we rely on fact telling more than ever and forget the power of storytelling. We focus so tightly on facts that story falls by the wayside—and with it, our ability to give those facts the context and meaning that makes them attractive to your audiences. 

### But I’m Not a Storyteller

Explanations do not need to follow the arc of a traditional story. 

You need to recognize the opportunities to present factual information through the lens of a person’s experience. This is the story we’ll use in explanations—a person’s experience. 

By adding a person to a narrative, we make the facts more meaningful and interesting. Using people in explanations makes them feel natural and real. 

> “Viewers remember what they feel.”

That, of course, is the goal—to create an explanation people remember because it made them *feel* something. 

### The Simple Ingredient: People 

Stories in explanations provide a human wrapper for ideas. And by wrapping ideas into a relatable story, we can make the appeal to people in a way that the ideas alone cannot. 

### Using Stories in Explanation

Start by coming up with the facts, then ask yourself: 
* Is this something we can make into a story? 
* If so, who is this person and what is their need? 
* What is their experience with this subject? 
* Will this add to the explanation? 

Characters help us take the facts and features out of the abstract and apply them to the real world through simple storytelling. 

Adding people to an explanation also keeps the focus on the big ideas by limiting what is reasonable. 

Therefore, when we approach an explanation with a story in mind, we start to see that characters have limits. Normal person would not use every single feature that a product has to offer, visit 10 stores at a time, etc… These are constraints that help us make the message more consumable and real. 

### Basic Story Format

* Meet Bob, he’s like you
* Bob has a problem that makes him feel bad
* Now Bob found a solution, and he feels good!
* Don’t you want to feel like Bob? 


### When Does Storytelling *Not* Work? 

When a product, idea, or service is inherently human-oriented, it is often a good opportunity to put storytelling into action. 

Every culture has its own culture, and that culture provides clues about the potential for using storytelling in an explanation. 

There are some organizations and cultures where stories just won’t fly. 

As powerful as stories can be, they take time. If your time is limited, storytelling may not be the best use of time. 

### Personification and Story

Personification helps put abstract ideas into a form that feel natural, familiar, or attractive to us. 

### On the Explanation Scale

Storytelling is but one option of many for the next step of the explanation (after context). 

## 8. Connections

It’s important to be able to connect an idea to something the audience already understands. 

If we can connect an old, easily understood idea to something new, we can help the audience feel confident that they can understand the new idea. 

When you make a connection, it’s important to indicate the problem, or then pain. This sets the stage for a conversation about how the new way can be better, different, and so on. 

When you make a connection to the old way, and present it in terms of pain, it sets up the new solution in a clear and understandable way. 

### Building-on Versus Establishing

The great thing about ‘building-on’ is that it builds on existing knowledge rather than trying to establish a completely new idea. 

Creating these connections is not a new communication idea; however, it’s often forgotten in the context of explanation. When someone asks us to explain something we may assume it is a new idea to the audience and approach the explanation from the new idea perspective. This can lead us to begin describing the idea via the details rather than looking for connection. 

Most products live in a world of connections to similar ideas. Ignoring these connections can reduce the potential for understanding a new product because new can often mean difficult to understand. 

However, making connections to related ideas may lead people to make unflattering comparisons. Marking and public relations teams often strive to prevent this from happening. Getting others to understand an idea often isn’t the most pressing priority. 

But the connections can be helpful in the context of explanation—when trying to make ideas easy to understand or show why the make sense—because the build on ideas people already know. 

If explanation is the intent and the goal, the benefits of making an idea easy to understand outweigh the potential costs of an unflattering connection. 

### Analogy

When two ideas connect, they are analogous. In an explanation, the use of analogy is the key to making ideas easy to understand. 

Differences between analogy, metaphor, and simile:
* Analogies explain.
* Metaphors and similes highlight. 

An analogy is an approach to solving a communication problem. They often show a connection between two ideas to make something clear. The emphasis is your intent to make a connections. 

Metaphors and similes are different because they are figures of speech that connect two unlike things to highlight a point. 

### On the Explanation Scale

Using connections is another way to build other’s confidence and lower the cost of figuring things out. It’s a stepping stone towards understanding. 

## 9. Description

Someone with relatively litter understanding may need to see the *why* of an idea more than the *how*. 

But someone people already understand the big idea, and may need explanations that focus on *how*. These people are more likely to have and informed perspective and need more tactical, detailed information. 

The difference between a recipe and an explanation is that a recipe tells you *how* to do something; an explanation does as well, but it also tells you *why* it makes sense. 

### On The Explanation Scale

Descriptions are valid and normal part of explanations and are best used when your audience has more understanding, where the priority is likely to be more focused on *how* than on *why*. 

> “Research indicates that when a student both sees and hears the information at once, the brain is more likely to retain it because the brain is processing on two different channels in parallel.”

## 10. Simplification

Often, ideas that are new to some people can seem unattainable. This has an impact on how experts explain the idea. 

The curse of knowledge causes explanations to be: 
* Accurate, yet incomprehensible
* Detailed to the point of being ineffective
* Filled with unfamiliar words
* Presented without context or application

However, when we consider simplification, we focus on transforming that complex bundle of details into big, understandable ideas that server as stepping-stones to future understanding. 

If you, as an expert, seriously want to help novice users understand complicated concepts, you must: 
* **Do not make assumptions** about what people already know. 
* Use the **most basic language** possible. C
* **Forget the details** and exceptions and focus on big ideas. 
* **Trade accuracy for understanding**. 
* Connect the basic ideas to **ideas the audience already understands**.

## 11. Constraints

The **Paradox of Choice** shows that too much choice often lead to unhappiness, and can even cause a person not to make a decision at all. 

This comes into play when we’re thinking through explanations. Our myriad choices can seem overwhelming and prevent us from feeling confident that we choose the correct analogy for instance. 

Before you even start the decision making process, define and limit your options to a couple of variables. In doing so, you narrow an overwhelming selection to a manageable number. 

This way, you are not liberated by endless choice, but rather by constraints. 

Constraints bring focus and attention to things that may have been overlooked otherwise. 

### Constraints and Your Explanations

* **Timeline**—when do you need to have the explanation ready? 
* **Duration**—how long should it take to explain? 
* **Location**—where will the explanation be presented? 
* **Format**—how will the information be presented?
* **Idea volume**—how many ideas can you explain in the defined duration? 
* **Language**—how technical is the language that the target audience speaks? 

## 12. Preparing for and Writing an Explanation

The best path to solving explanation problems and making ideas easier to understand is to have explanations in writing, where they can evolve before being presented. 

Although explanation may be presented in text form and can be effective, it is the *process* of writing that clarifies an explanation an gives it a form that can be presented in many ways. 

### Research and Discovery

> “Common Craft videos do not focus on presenting new facts so much as packaging existing facts into new, more understandable forms. This means that our research and discovery is not only focused on the facts themselves, but also on how they have been communicated or explained in the past.”

### The Basic Script

#### Agreement

These are noncontroversial statements that start to frame the explanations directions. For examplexample, “We can all agree that …”

By making these statements, we give the audience easily graspable and understood informations. 

#### Context—Problem/pain and vision of solutions

State, in clear terms, a problem that everyone understands. There is a problem and it’s painful. 

Next, present a vision for the future. These are often *what if* statements that inspire the audience to imagine a world in which this problem has been solved. 

The explanation has been general at this point, and we started to build confidence and context. Now the audience is looking or an answer. 

The next step in our process depends on the situation, but the goal is always the same: we want to present and idea in the most understandable way possible for a specific audience. 

Here we can use the stories, connections, and descriptions discussed in previous chapters. 

#### Realization

Now that we’ve shown the idea at work an given that audience a new perspective, we can show them the outcome: how the idea will change lives or actually works. 

#### Call to Action

Finally, we wrap the explanation up with an invitation to take an action. 

This can be an invitation to learn more, contact someone, or try a product or service. 

## 13. Bringing an Explanation Together

Just a example / case study. 

## Part 3: Present

## 14. Common Craft’s Lessons Learned

### State Your Intentions Early

Context is an important part of careering an explanation, and perhaps the first chance we have to build context is the title we give our work. 

The title become a way to show the video’s intention is to accomplish a specific goal. 

### Solve a Problem

If you can create an explanation that solves a problem and helps people feel confident about an idea, it will make an impression and create demand for more. 

### Keep It Short

This is one of the constraints that matters most. If a video explanation is too long, the cost to view it becomes too high an people will ignore it. 

### Reduce Noise

People are surrounded by noise all the time, whether it’s that of their coworkers or the visual noise of a complicated software interface. 

We live with noise so constantly we’ve gotten used to it. 

That’s why experiences designed to reduce noise stand out and attract our attention. 

### Use Visuals

Many people are visual learners. Although text is the basis of any explanation, the combination of text and visuals can be greater than the sum of the parts.
