# The Art of Explanation
### Making your ideas, produces and services easier to understand
### By Lee LeFever

## Part 1: Plan

### 1. Learning to Run

Analogy that learning to explain is like learning to run. You can get better but most people don’t realize they suck at it, and that there are ways to improve. 

### 2. What Is an Explanation? 

Miriam Webster definition of v. explain: 
> To make Known; to make plain or understandable.

Wikipedia definition of explanation: 
> An explanation is a set of statements constructed to describe a set of facts which clarifies the causes, context and consequences of those facts. 

An explanation is an *act or process* that makes something *known, plain or understandable*.

**Explanation**— An explanation describes facts in a way that makes them understandable. The intent of an explanation is to increase understanding. 

What do great explainers have in common? **Empathy.**

Great explainers have the ability to picture themselves in another person’s shoes and communicate from that perspective. 

Explanation is a powerful asset in a world of constant change; because it can lower the cost of understanding, it invites people to participate in a variety of new topics. 

Explanation is the art of not just packaging facts but presenting them in a way that answers the question *”Why?”*— as in, why does it make sense to do this? Or, why should I care? 

Explanation is not focused on facts, laws, or specifics. Explanation is the art of showing why the facts, laws and specifics make sense. By clarifying the reason that an idea makes sense, we can put the facts into perspective.

As such, **explanation is the practice of packaging facts into a form that makes them easier to understand and apply**. 

Explanations that make people care also have another benefit: **people who care about and ideas are often motivated to learn more**.

The act of explaining helps us understand anode more completely. 

### 3. Why Explanations Fail

Blank stares often arise when someone has lost confidence that they can grasp— or should even care about— the idea you are communication. 

**Curse of knowledge**: When we know a subject very well, we have a difficult time imagining what it is like not to know it. 

Our level of knowledge interferes with our ability to see the world from another person’s perspective and gauge their confidence level accurately.

When you talk about an idea and you see blank stares, it could be the curse of knowledge at work. People are losing condense, and you explanation is starting to fail. 

The more we live in a culture and use it’s own language, the more the curse of knowledge grows. Certain words and phrases become so common that we start to lose touch with how they sound to people who live outside of that culture. 

**A single word can make your explanation fail because it lowers confidence. One word has the power to move someone from interest to disinterest.**

Explanation fail when we are unable to translate the language of our work to the language of a possibly uninformed audience. 

#### The direct approach

When people ask questions like *”How does that work?”*, we tend to answer the question directly if we know the answer. It feels efficient. 

The problem is that this can cause the listener to lose confidence. The question wanted for an **explanation**, what they received was a **statement of fact**.

Giving direct, accurate, and factual answers may seem to solve the problem from the perspective of the answerer. But in reality, it can shut the asker down. 

**When they lose confidence, they won’t dare to ask follow up questions or probe for related ideas. Any hope of being a customer of that idea is lost**. 

### 4. Planning Your Explanations

Without a way to explain an idea effectively, we limit its ability to spread. 

#### The explanation scale

This is a simple A-to-Z continuum that is a guid to planning explanations. It’s a way to think of moving your audience from one point to another. 

The goal is to move people down the scale, representing a path to understanding an idea. 

## Part 2: Package

### 5. Packaging Ideas

The solution to make ideas easier for others to understand is packaging. There are innumerable ways to package ideas, but they focus on a few elements: 

**Agreement**: builds confidence from first sentence. This is accomplished through big picture statements that most people recognize. i.e. “We can all agree that gas prices are rising.”

**Context**: moves the agreed points into a specific place. Gives audience a foundation for the explanation, tells them why it matters. * i.e. “More of your hard earned income is going to pay for transportation”

**Story**: Applies the big ideas to a narrative. Shows a person who experiences a change in perspective and the emotions that accompany that change. * i.e. “Meet Sally; she’s tired of paying so much for gas and needs alternatives. Here’s what she found:”

**Connections**: These often accompany a story and are analogies and metaphors that connect new ideas to something a person already understand. i.e. “Sally could see that taking the bus was like multitasking because she could work and commute at the same time.”

**Descriptions**: direct communications that are more focused on how versus why. i.e. “Sally found that she could save more than $20 a week by taking the bus 3x weekly”

**Conclusions**: Wraps up the packaged with a summary of what was learned, and provides a next step with focus on the audience. i.e. “The next time gas prices get you down, remember…”
