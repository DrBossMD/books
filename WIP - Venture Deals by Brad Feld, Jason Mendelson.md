# Venture Deals

## 1. The Players

**Cap table** (capitalization table): The spreadsheet that defines the economics of the deal. 

There are specific SEC rules around accredited investors, and you should make sure that each of your angel investors qualifies as one. 

A **syndicate**: a collection of investors. 

## 2. How to raise money

When we meet people who say they are “trying to raise money,” “testing the waters,” or “exploring different options,” this not only is a turnoff, but also often shows they’ve not had much success. Start with an attitude of presuming success. 

**Don’t say you are raising between a range.**
* The range makes it appear like you hare heeding your bets, or that you haven’t thought hard about how much money you need. 
* Always state you are raising a specific number. 
* You can always exceed that if demand is high. 

#### Fund raising materials: 

Short description
* 1-3 paragraphs that you can email 
* Describe product, team, and business very directly. 

Executive summary
* 1-3 page description of your idea, product, team, and business. 
* It’s the basis for your first impression and will be passed around. 
* Include:
** problems you are solving, and why they are important
** why is your product awesome? 
** why is it better than what currently exists? 
** why is your team the right one? 
** some high level financial data

Presentation
* 10-20 page keynote
* Make sure it’s really well designed, especially for consumer companies
* Few things VC care about and need to get excited about a deal:
** problem you are solving
** size of opportunity
** strength of team
** competition and your competitive advantage
** plan of attack
** current status
** Summary financials, use of proceeds, and milestones are also important. 

Detailed financial model
* VCs know 100% of them are wrong.
* Focus on: 
** The assumptions underlying the revenue forecast
** Monthly burn rate or cash consumption

VCs give off 4 typical vibes: 

* Clearly interested and wants to lead. 
** Engage aggressively.
* Not interested and will pass.
** Don’t worry, move on.
* Maybe. 
** Seems interested, but low engagement. 
** Don’t expect them to catalyze your deal, but keep in the loop.
** They will probably follow if a good firm invests. 
* Slow no.
* They respond when you contact them, but never any forward motion. 
* Treat as no, and don’t waste time. 

## 3. Overview of the term sheet.

**Economics** refers to the return the investors will ultimately get in a liquidity event. 

**Control** refers to the mechanisms that allow investors either to affirmatively exercise control over the business to to veto certain decisions. 

When companies are created founders receive **common stock**. However, when VCs invest in companies, they usually receive **preferred stock**. 

## 4. Economic Terms of the Term Sheet

#### Price

Although **price per share** is the ultimate measure of what is being paid for the equity being bought, **price** is often referred to as **valuation**.

**Pre-money** valuation is what the investor is vauluating the company at today, before the investment. 

**Post-money** is the pre-money valuation plus the contemplated aggregate investment amount.

The **option/employee pool** is reserved to compensate and motivate the workforce. 

Although a large option pool will make it less likely that the company will run out of options, the size of the pool is taken into account int he valuation of the company, thereby effectively lowering the actual pre money valuation. 

If investors believe that the option pool is too small, they will typically insist the increase happens prior to the financing. 

**VCs want to minimize their risk of future dilution by making the option pool as large as possible up front.**
* Come armed with an option budget.
* Make a list of all the hires you plan on making between today and your next financing date, and approximate the size of the option pool you need. 
* Be prepared to have some margin, but not necessarily a huge margin.

A **warrant** is a right for an investor to purchase a certain number of shares at a predefined price for a certain number of years. 
* Warrants tend to create a lot of unnecessary complexity, especially during early stages. 
* If the issue is of price, we recommend the entrepreneur negotiate a lower price instead of warrants. 

Warrants, are commonplace in **bridge-loans**.

**Convertible debt** is an investment that will convert into equity at the price of the upcoming financing. 

A **flat round** is when you raise money at a price equal to your previous valuation. 

A **down round** is when you raise money at a price lower than your previous valuation.

How do VCs value companies? 
* The stage of the company. 
* Competition with other funding sources. 
* Experience of the founding team. 
* The VC's natural entry point.
* Numbers, numbers, numbers. (performance, revenue, metrics)
* Current economic climate. 

#### Liquidation Preferences

The liquidation preference impacts how the proceeds are shared in a liquidity event. 

A **liquidity event** is usually defined as a sale of the company or the majority of the company's assets. 

There are three varieties of participation: 
* Full participation
* Capped participation
* No participation

**Fully participating** stock will receive its participation amount and the share in the liquidation proceeds on an as **as-converted basis.**
* As converted means
