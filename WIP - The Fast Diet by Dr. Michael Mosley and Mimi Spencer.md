# 0. Introduction

There is nothing else you can do to your body that is as powerful as fasting.

Your body is designed to fast. We evolved at a time when food was scarce. 

Fasting reduces many of the things that promote aging, while increasing th body’s ability to protect and repair itself. 

Calorie restriction is pretty brutal; it involves eating much less than a normal person would, and doing so for every day of your life. People put themselves through this because it is the only intervention that has been shown to extend lifespan, at least in animals. 

# 1. The Science of Fasting

### Eating small meals
The idea that eating little and often is a “good thing” is mainly driven by snack manufacturers and faddish diet books, but also has support from the medical establishment. 

The argument is that it’s better to eat lots of small meals because that way we’re less likely to get hungry and gorge on high-fat junk. Studies have suggested there are health benefits to eating small meals regularly, as long as you don’t simply end up eating more. 

Does eating lots of small meals increase your metabolic rate and help you lose weight?
